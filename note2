The error you're encountering indicates that phpMyAdmin cannot connect to your MySQL server due to authentication issues. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. **Check Configuration File**:
   - Locate the `config.inc.php` file for phpMyAdmin (usually found in the phpMyAdmin directory).
   - Ensure that the MySQL credentials (username and password) are set correctly. Look for lines similar to:
     ```php
     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'your_username';
     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'your_password';
     ```
   - If you're using `root`, make sure the password is correct (if you have set one).

2. **Verify MySQL User Permissions**:
   - Log into MySQL from the command line using:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Check if the user exists and has the necessary permissions:
     ```sql
     SELECT host, user FROM mysql.user;
     ```
   - If the user doesnâ€™t exist, you can create it:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

3. **Password Authentication**:
   - If you don't want to use a password, ensure that the MySQL user is configured for passwordless access, which is generally not recommended for security reasons.

4. **Check MySQL Service**:
   - Ensure that the MySQL service is running. You can restart it with:
     ```bash
     sudo service mysql restart
     ```

5. **Firewall/Network Issues**:
   - If you're accessing MySQL remotely, check for firewall rules that might be blocking access.

6. **Testing Connection**:
   - Try connecting to MySQL directly from the command line using the credentials you specified in the configuration file to ensure they are correct.

7. **Log Files**:
   - Check MySQL and phpMyAdmin log files for additional error messages that might provide more insight into the issue.

After making changes, try accessing phpMyAdmin again to see if the issue is resolved.
